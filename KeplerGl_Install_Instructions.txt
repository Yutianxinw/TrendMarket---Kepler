#This is the steps on how to install Kepler.gl and then be able to run inside of Jupytr Notebook
#These steps requires Anoconda to work, so please already have that installed.
#First open up Anoconda, and launch "anaconda_prompt". 
#In the terminal that launches, run the following command to install Kepler.gl

conda install conda-forge::keplergl

#Once that runs, you should get three done messages at the end to show a succesful install.
#Following this, we need to install the extension so it works in Juptyr Notebook. 
#So same deal as the last one, run the following command in that terminal

conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

#Again, should get the three done messages at the end. Now we need to enable it.
#First validate it installed the Kepler extension with the following

jupyter nbextension install --py --sys-prefix keplergl

#Once you get a Validate okay, then it is installed properly. 
#If it is not Validated, rerun the previous two commands in a new terminal to repair the instalation
#If it is okay, simply just run the following to enable it

jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix keplergl

#Once you get the validate okay again, you can open up Juptyr notebook from Anaconda.
#Make a new notebook, and run the following simple code to ensure it works and displays the map.
